What is TermTA

* TermTA is an on-line terminal program designed specifically for use in
  playing TeleArena, the popular BBS door game.
* TermTA is an interface composed of graphics and sound.

The advantage of using TermTA is that it is custom designed just for
playing the game. Thus you have a lot of features that your normal
term program like Telemate or QModem can't offer.

To help make learning TermTA as easy as possible, I've broken the docs
into these files...

!READ.NOW     Read this before you actually run TermTA for any special
              information.
!TTA.DOC      This file. Explains what TermTA is, how to run it, and the
              available features.
!SCRIPT.DOC   Explains TermTA's script language, so you can start coding
              your own custom macros for use in TermTA.
!WHATNEW.DOC  What's changed in this recent version.
!ORDER.FRM    How to register quickly and get in on the extra TermTA
              features.

*************************************************************************
Here's What You Get By Registering TermTA
(please see !ORDER.FRM for more info)

TermTA is marketed under the shareware concept. It is not a FREE program.
As shareware.. you are granted a right to try TermTA for a short trial
period (1-2 weeks should be enough to get to know the program well). At the
end of that time you must decide whether to keep the program or delete it.

Here's one way to test whether you should keep the program...
After your trial period go back to playing TA with your regular comm program.
If you find you can still play and enjoy TA with your comm program, then
you don't need TermTA. But if you find it harder to play and enjoy TA, then
please, register your copy of TermTA with me. Your registration grants you
a license to keep using the program for all your playing needs.

Besides.. there are many more benefits you'll get by registering...

1) Complete set of maps for playing TA. (Well maybe not complete, as new
   versions of TA come out with more new areas. But you will get enough 
   maps to get you a BLUE rune at least)

2) Expanded monster database so your Auto Attack feature will work on ALL
   monsters.

3) Ability to configure Health Monitor to NONE and GR instead of just HE.

4) Your key will get rid of those annoying registration screens and delays
   you get when exiting TermTA.

5) Your key is good for future upgrades. That means you can not only access
   the registered features now in TermTA, but in any and all upgrades
   coming out in the future!

6) Gets rid of the announcement that you are using TermTA when entering TA

7) Then there is all that goodwill stuff, you're helping the development
   so I can bring you a bigger and better TermTA (and prices will go up as
   the program gets bigger.. so get in now while it's cheap).

To register.. see the ending screen of TermTA for address. Better yet,
print the !ORDER.FRM file and fill it out now!!

How To Start TermTA

Syntax:  TTA DatabaseName Switch

Where "DatabaseName" is a name you have chosen for this database. You must
supply a name. If you don't enter it on the command line, then TERMTA will
ask you for one before it will run. The purpose of the "DatabaseName" is
for those who play in more then one game of TA and thus may have different
characters with different configurations. I usually call my database the
same name as the BBS the game is on. Easy to remember then, which database
goes to which game of TeleArena.

Where "Switch" can be any letter or number. "Switch" is OPTIONAL, but if
used, MUST follow the "DatabaseName". The purpose of "Switch" is to bypass
TERMTA's prompt that asks if you want to dial a BBS. Sometimes you may
already be online when you want to start TERMTA. In those cases you won't
need to dial and log onto a BBS. Thus you don't need to be bothered by
TERMTA's prompt asking if you want to dial in. Just enter any character
here. If character found, prompt is bypassed.

There are 3 ways to use TERMTA:

1) Offline. TERMTA can be run offline for various things.
  
2) You can use TERMTA to connect to a BBS.

3) You can start TERMTA after you have already connected to the BBS
   using your comm program.

   If you need to use your comm program for logging onto the BBS (in case
   you want/need to do other things on-line like file transfers, etc..)

   You can always Exit/Shell from your comm program (make sure not to drop
   carrier) and then start TERMTA.

   Just make sure to answer NO when asked if you want to dial a BBS
   (no need to dial since you are already online) or use the optional
   "Switch" parameter on the command line to bypass this step.

   When using this method, make sure your comm program connects to the BBS
   at the same settings you have configured in TERMTA. Simply go to TERMTA's
   F8 menu (do this offline). Jot down the modem settings (baud, port,
   handshaking, etc), and set your comm program to use the same settings.

   Then call your BBS with your comm program. Do your e-mail, file transfers,
   etc.. When ready to play TA, exit your comm without dropping carrier
   (if you are shelling, you should set your comm program to swap itself to
   XMS/EMS), start TERMTA. Play TA.

   When done playing you can log off the BBS while in TERMTA, or exit
   TERMTA and return to your comm program.

   If you decide that after playing TA, you need to get back in your comm
   program, you can do so without having to redial the BBS. Simply exit
   TERMTA and start your comm program WITHOUT sending the modem init string.
   In Telemate, you would use the /O switch to do this.

   FINAL NOTES:
   If you shell to DOS to run TERMTA, or use a hotkey, you'll probably wise
   to configure your comm program to shell itself to EMS/XMS/DISK.

   With this method, I recommend starting TERMTA while you are at your
   BBS's main menu prompt. Make sure if you get a lot of global messages,
   that they are turned off first before starting TERMTA

How to use features with Mouse or Keyboard

Previously I explained how to start TERMTA and how to correct any problems
when running it. So this section will focus on how to use the Mouse or
Keyboard to move around in TERMTA.

When using the keyboard, the following keys run the following features:
You can use the mouse to click on these also.
   
   F1   Macros                CTRL-C   Open/Close a capture file
   F2   Config Menu           CTRL-D   Shell to DOS
   F3   View Maps             CTRL-G   Group Health Display
   F4   Display Exits         CTRL-E   Your Health Display
   F5   Auto Share            CTRL-T   List Exits
   F6   Auto Roam             CTRL-F   List Items For Sale
   F7   Auto Restore          CTRL-S   List your Stats
   F8   Auto Reroll           CTRL-K   List your Spells
   F9   Auto Attack           CTRL-B   Scrollback buffer
   F10  Auto Heal             CTRL-L   Look
                              CTRL-A   Dial BBS
                              CTRL-I   List your Inventory
                              CTRL-X   Display your Experience points

Besides the above, TERMTA comes with a script language for making macros.
These Macros can be found on the Macro Screen (F7). TERMTA assigns each
macro to a letter. These macros can be run by using the ALT key and the
letter for that macro.

To use a mouse to run the ALT key macros, simply click on the letter
at the TOP of the TERMTA screen.

                         MOVEMENT KEYS 

As you know TA requires you to type in NW, NE, etc to move around.
This can be slow and tiring (not to mention boring). TERMTA
alleviates this problem by allowing you other choices for moving.

Mouse:  Use the left mouse button to click on the on-screen compass, or
        up/down buttons

Keypad: Use the numeric keypad (make sure Num Lock is off) for moving.

                                N
                         [ 7 ][ 8 ][ 9 ]
                       W [ 4 ]     [ 6 ] E
                         [ 1 ][ 2 ][ 3 ]
                         [ 0 ][ . ]
                          Up  Down

Of course, you can still type in the commands manually at the command line
should you so desire.

***************************************************************************
Features of TermTA

------------>>>>>>>>>>>  F1 - MACROS   <<<<<<<<<<<<--------------

The Macro Menu displays all the macros you have available to use. You'll
also see a special FLIP button. This allows you to toggle the display of
macros. When you first open the menu you will see a description of your
macros. By using the FLIP button you can display (and edit/add) the macro's
script code.

Your macros are saved in a text file called TTAMACRO.FIL. You can create
these macros off-line or while on-line from within TermTA.

To create custom macros that TermTA understands you'll need to use
TermTA's script language (see !SCRIPT.DOC for complete details).

                        ------------------------
NOTE: While running a macro, should you wish to abort it, simply press the
      <ESC> key. Sometimes, if you coded the macro wrong, you could find
      yourself in an endless loop (you'll know it when the screen stops
      displaying and none of the keys in TermTA work). Again, press <ESC>
      until you exit from such a loop.
                        ------------------------

The easiest way to create your macros is within TermTA. However if
you would like to create the TTAMACRO.FIL file off-line in a word processor
the format is as follows:

1) Add a "'" to the beginning of the description line
2) put the description line above the macro line

Not all macros need to be described. Here are some examples of proper format:

EXAMPLE 1 (both macros described):

'drinks water
{send dr wat;}{}
'looks around
{send look;}{}

EXAMPLE 2 (only third macro described):

{send eat rat;}{}
{send reroll;}{}
'look around
{send look;}{}

If all this is confusing to you, then create your macros and descriptions
in TermTA. Then Exit TermTA or Shell to DOS and examine the TTAMACRO.FIL
file to see the format it is created in.

---------->>>>>>>>>>>  F2 - CONFIG MENU <<<<<<<<<<<<------------

Here you can configure TermTA to work with TA.

Some things you'll need to configure is your modem settings for that BBS,
whether you want sound on or off, and the commands you want to use with
Auto Restore, Auto Heal, and Auto Attack.

Auto Restore commands can cure you from Thirst, Hunger, and Poison.
The Auto Heal commands are used for restoring Vitality and Mana.
The Auto Attack commands are used each round when attacking.

* To configure Vitality, enter how many vitality points you wish to lose
  before your Vitality will be healed.

  Ex: Your heal spell cures for 150 damage. Therefor, configure TermTA to
      heal when you have lost 130 points or so of Vitality.

* To configure Mana, you specify how many points you must have LEFT before
  the Mana heal command goes off.

  Ex: For healing yourself, your spell requires 4 mana. When your mana gets
      to 3 points or less, you will no longer be able to cast your heal
      (or attack) spell. Therefor, 3 is a good time to restore Mana. So
      enter "3" when configuring the Mana heal.

* To configure your Attack Sequence, you'll need to enter:

  1) the number of attacks per round (before you have to rest).
  2) how many seconds you need to rest for.
  3) How you want to attack. You can attack with your weapon, use a magic
     item, or cast spells. Simply type in your command (minus the monster
     name as TermTA will find which monster it is and add the monster name
     automatically). 

   Examples:  A         if you want to ATTACK
              Use rod   to use the magic rod
              C teka    to cast a teka spell

   NOTE: When using an area spell here, add a "*" to the beginning of the
   command to tell TermTA it is an area spell and thus NOT to add name
   of monster to command.

  4) Monitor health. This option allows you to monitor your Vitality/Mana
     as you are attacked. Every time you get hit, your health will be 
     displayed. Whether you want to heal yourself or not, is up to you.
     Health monitoring only occurs while Auto-Attack is on.

     If you are going to using AUTO HEAL for healing while in combat,
     then you must use "HE" here.

     Unregistered users, must monitor health via HE. Registered users can
     monitor health via TA's HE or GR command (or NONE, in case you want to
     turn it off).

------------------>>>>>>>   F3 - SELECT MAP   <<<<<<<<<-------------------

This window displays your available maps and allows you to choose one for
viewing. You can also add your own maps to TermTA by giving them an
extension of .MAP

* Registered users get a full set of maps for TA. (at least up to the
  BLUE Rune). New maps will be added as future editions of TeleArena 
  are released with new areas.

Personally I prefer to print out the maps that come with the registered
version instead of using F3 and/or F4 to view them. But it is here in case
you don't have a printer.

--------------->>>>>>>>  F4 - DISPLAY EXITS  <<<<<<<<<<<-----------------

When DISP EXITS (works only for TeleArena 5.5 or later versions) is ON,
TERMTA will display the exits for every room you enter or are in. Only
exception being those times you are in combat. Don't need to move when
fighting, so no use to display. Makes for screen displays and attacks.

Required for using Auto Roam.

------------------>>>>>>>>  F5 - AUTO SHARE  <<<<<<<<<<<-----------------

This nifty feature will share with your group all the gold you find while
fighting in groups. Now you no longer need to worry about sharing when
fighting. Keep your mind on the attack always.

------------------>>>>>>>>  F6 - AUTO ROAM  <<<<<<<<<<<-----------------

Don't have much time for playing TA but still want to get experience points
so you can advance? This feature will move your character about fighting 
and healing as required.

To use this feature, first turn on Auto Heal, Auto Attack, and Auto Exits.
Then turn on this feature and away you go. Sit back and let TERMTA do all
the work for you.

Of course this feature is not 100% safe. Another player and/or monster
could be encountered that can inflict damage on you faster then you can.
heal. Thus leading to your death. Therefor I recommend you at least monitor
the game in case something extremely dangerous is encountered. Or set your
character loose in areas with easy monsters.

When you first start the feature, you will be prompted in which direction
to go. Simply enter the direction. You can also just push ENTER if you want
to accept TermTA's default direction. The default direction is the leftmost
direction displayed on the "Exits:" line.

Ex:  Exits: s,sw,e,u

The default for the above is "S". So no need to type S, just hit ENTER.

This is a really fun feature. Just see how far your character can travel
while killing along the way. In my first attempt with it.. I travelled from
Town 1 all the way to Flagstones. All done by itself.

---------------->>>>>>>>  F7 - AUTO RESTORE  <<<<<<<<<<--------------------

Auto Restore when ON, detects when your Hungry, Thirsty, or Poisoned.
If hungry, it'll will eat food automatically (as long as you have the items
in your possession). By default, when thirsty you drink water, when
poisoned you will drink Verbena. However, using F2 you can configure TERMTA
to use spells for restoring if your character has those abilities.

---------------->>>>>>>>  F8 - AUTO REROLL <<<<<<<<<<<------------------

Just starting a new character? You'll love how easy this feature rerolls
for you. Simply enter the minimum stats you will accept and TermTA rerolls
for you until it finds stats that meet your minimum requirements.

So sit back and watch some TV while TermTA rerolls for you and gets you
the best character with the least amount of hassle.

If you're like most folks, you're probably wondering what's the best stats
for your character. What stats should you try to achieve. With TermTA its
no problem as you can quickly find out the highest stats possible for
your character in each of the 6 categories. To do this.. do a short test
reroll first. Start it by specifying some incredibly high stats. Let it
reroll about 10 times. TermTA will display the highest stats possible.

I don't know how long, or if it's even possible, to roll a character with 
the maximum stats in each area. So I suggest you try for stats that are
-1 or -2 from max in a few areas and maybe -4 or -5 in the other areas.
Or maybe take off 3 points of the max for all areas and see what you can
come up with.

The nice thing about using TermTA for rerolling is that you can reroll
as long as you have time on the BBS. So if you have unlimited time..
go for near max stats and reroll for 23 hours at a time (BBS usually
shut down for maintenance 1 hour per day). TermTA can be configured to
log you off the BBS when done so you don't need to be at the keyboard
for these long sessions. Do it while you sleep!!

WARNING!  I'd hate to see your new maxed out character die after a full
          day of rerolling because you weren't at the keyboard and you
          got thirsty. So I recommend that before you start your reroll
          process, test the feature first to make sure it logs off
          correctly. Different BBS's have different ways. That's why I
          included 3 different ways to get out of TA when done.
          To run a test, just enter some low stats. Stats that can be
          hit on the first reroll and then see what happens when reroll
          ends. If all works fine then start your reroll. If not, run
          another test on one of the other methods. Dropping carrier works
          on all systems except I'm unsure if all systems will save your
          new stats when you exit this way.

WARNING!  It has been brought to my attention that some games of TA have
          a rest in them that will keep you from rerolling to quickly.
          Because of this, when starting the REROLL feature you are given
          a prompt asking what the delay is on your BBS. Simply enter the
          number of seconds here. If you enter an amount of time that is
          too long or too short, then restart the REROLL feature to specify
          another delay.

---------------->>>>>>>>  F9 - AUTO ATTACK  <<<<<<<<<<<------------------

When Auto Attack is ON, TermTA will launch your attack sequence against
the monster in any room you enter, or if a monster arrives in your area.
Excellent way to defend yourself or for launching offensive maneuvers.

For this to work effectively, you need to configure your attack sequence
using TermTA's F2 (Config Menu). You can have it attack with weapons,
magic, or spells.

In order for TermTA to attack, it needs to recognize the monster to be
attacked (area spells don't need to worry about this). To handle this,
TermTA comes with a built-in database of the 13 most common monsters in TA.

* Registered users get the complete Monster Database of over 60 monsters.
  In addition, this database can be modified so the user can add more
  monsters in the event of new TA releases or if your Sysop configures new
  monsters for your game.

The Auto Attack feature allows you to monitor your health while in combat.
To do that.. specify "HE" or "GR" on the Auto Attack Menu. If you wish to
use Auto Heal while in Auto Attack mode, then make sure to specify "HE"
as that is the only display TermTA uses at this time (since it is the only
one to show Vitality and Mana).

SPECIAL NOTES ON USING AREA SPELLS:

* When using Auto Attack, TermTA senses which monster is in the room and
  automatically adds the monsters name to the end of your attack command.

  When using an area spell as one of your attack commands, you don't want
  the monsters name added to the end of the command. So you need a way to
  inform TermTA the command it is about to issue is an area spell. To
  specify an area spell, just add a "*" to the beginning of the command.

Example:  You want to cast an attack spell at a monster. On the Attack Menu
          type in: C KAMAKAZI. TermTA automatically sends C KAMAKAZI <name>.
          
          If KAMAKAZI was an area spell, then the above would not work. So
          therefor, on the Attack Menu you would type: *C KAMAKAZI. TermTA
          would then only send "C KAMAKAZI" and thus would work effectively.

* One more thing about using area spells with TermTA. TermTA has a built-in
  safety lock. When you use Auto Attack (F9 - which runs the attack sequence
  specified on the Attack Menu) to fire off area spells, it will first check
  to see if there are any VISIBLE players in the room that are not part of
  your group. If it finds such a player, it will not fire the area spell. If
  all is clear.. BOOM it shoots. Thus you can't kill innocent players with it
  (unless you want to - see next paragraph).

  If you do want to kill innocent players with your area spells.. I suggest
  you use the Macro Menu (F1) to create yourself an area spell macro. Then
  run that macro manually when needed using the ALT key it is assigned to.

  OR.. if you are a registered user.. you can add players names to your
  "hit list". If those players are encountered, TermTA will treat them just
  like a monster and your area spell will fire.

* When using an area spell, it must be configured to be your first attack
  command in your attack sequence (or round). Say you get 6 attacks per
  round (sequence) and you want to use an area spell, then your attack
  sequence may look like this:
                       
                     1 -    Cast Area Spell
                     2 -    Attack
                     3 -    Attack
                     4 -    Attack
                     5 -    Use Rod
                     6 -    Attack
  
  TermTA will work in the following manner:
  If safe to fire area spell, TermTA launches: 1,2,3,4,5, and 6
  If not safe, TermTA launches: 2,2,3,4,5, and 6

  So you see.. if it is not safe to area, then the command in slot 2 will
  be substituted for what's in slot 1. This way you always get your 6
  attacks per round.

  Now it's also possible to use an attack spell as a substitute in case
  the area spell is bypassed. Since you get one spell per round, you may
  as well use an attack one if you can't use the area. Won't go into the
  details here how to do it, just play with your Attack Menu (F2) and I'm
  sure you will figure it out.

---------------->>>>>>>>  F10 - AUTO HEAL  <<<<<<<<<<<------------------

Auto Heal when ON, will restore your vitality and your Mana. By default it
will drink an Anemone potion when you lose 60 vitality points, or drink a
Yarrow when your Mana falls to 0.

However you can configure these figures to what ever you want.. like 
casting Kusamotu, or perhaps drinking a Zary instead. You can also configure when you want to heal yourself rather then using the 60 default points.
See more about this under the "F2 - Config Menu" above.

SPECIAL NOTE on Auto Heal:  This feature works by reading the "HE" display.
Whenever you enter "HE" it will run a check to see if you need healing.
You can also use Auto Heal while in Auto Attack mode. Just make sure to
specify the "HE" command (default setting) on the Attack Menu (F2).


----------------->>>>>>>>  <CTRL> KEYS  <<<<<<<<<<<--------------------

In addition to "F" keys, TermTA has 13 keys assigned for running other
features.

<CTRL> L, S, I, E, G, AND X  displays your stats and other items of
interest. By using these keys, you can save yourself some typing.

<CTRL> D  Will shell you to DOS if needed

<CTRL> B  Will display the scrollback buffer in case something you need
to see has already scrolled off the screen.

<CTRL> A  Brings up the BBS phone numbers in your dialing list. Useful
if you want to dial/redial a BBS.

<CTRL> C  With this you can easily save a playing session to disk in a
text file. Simply enter the name for the file and MMTERM automatically
adds an extension of .CAP.

If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. If a file with the same name
exists, you will have the option of overwriting it (erases old file) or not
(in which case the new info is added to the end of the old file).

<CTRL> K  Here you can easily display all the spells in your book. BUT,
with TermTA you get an added bonus that TeleArena doesn't give you. All of
the spells in your Spell Book come with a description. Now you'll never
forget what each spell does.

<CTRL> F  When in a shop, use this to display the items for sale.

<CTRL> P  Here you can find commands that work in TA and other useful
information about the game. Works online or off.
