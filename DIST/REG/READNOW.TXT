There are 2 text database files with the registered version of TermTA.
One contains the names and descriptions of the spells in the game. The
other has names of monsters in TermTA. (both have a file extension of .DAT)

There may come a time when more monsters or more spells are added to TA.
When this happens, you'll need to upgrade your database by adding the
new spells and/or new monsters.

This can easily be done with a word processor or text editor. Simply load
the database you want to modify. Add the name of the monster or spell to
the end of the database. Make sure you also correct the "SIZE =" line in
each database to reflect the correct number of entries into that database.
